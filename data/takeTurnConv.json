Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart.

Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ah that's great. My wife also likes Target a lot.

Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years.

I feel like my answer would have to be carrots. Although, I would be afraid of turning orange after a few weeks! What about you?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Yeah, turning orange would be a drawback! That turns my mind to nutrition so I suddenly want to say Soylent or one of those other \"complete foods\", which I think defeats the purpose of the question.

I work in a technical role so I like to take arts and crafts-type classes now and then 🙂 Pottery sounds like a lot of fun"}]}

I like white teas, like silver needle."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hmm I'm not sure, I just get them from a Chinese supermarket haha You seem really knowledgeable about the different kinds of teas 🙂 What made you develop this interest?"}]}

How was the travel?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It was an interesting trip. I got to see some exotic places. For example, I hiked the Son Doong cave in Vietnam. It's the biggest and deepest cave in the world."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Great! Vietnam is still in my TODO bucket list. Did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes. Laos and Cambodia are the two neighboring countries. Cambodia has an exotic culture. They sell spiders, scorpions, and grasshoppers as street food! It took a lot of courage for me to try them."}]}

This whole team is always living the future."}]}

It makes me feel more confident about the work I am doing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Some people underestimate the importance of planning, but I think it's very important to have the correct plan. Executing the wrong plan is terrible. Also, planning is fun. You can stack up so many ideas and get great feedbacks."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "True! I think we should set aside some time to discuss some project details? Does tomorrow afternoon work for you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah tomorrow afternoon works for me. Let me set a time on your calendar. Is 3pm good?"}]}

Do you always prefer lunch sync over regular meeting syncs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah right, I heard the food there is good. I am not sure what they serve there for lunch? On wednesdays."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ah, good thought, thanks!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes. When my top favorite food looks like: cookies, M&M, danish cheese, etc., I know that I have a thing for sweet food. But who doesn't love sweet food? How about you?"}]}

But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah I'm afraid I wouldn't. I feel very guilty every time I gulp down an ice cream. But hey, these days there are many types of guilt-free sweet food. For example, there's this ice cream brand called <REDACTED_TERM>. It's only 320 calories a pint. And yes, it preserves most of the normal sweet flavors."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Interesting. I heard about the sweet substitute in a program called the Keto diet. Basically, we try to limit our sugar intake every day. Successful Keto dieters have recommended the <REDACTED_TERM> ice cream to fill their insatiable crave for sugar."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My family eats healthier than I do, so it's all mine 😛 do you like stuffing? I feel like that's only available once a year"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Also more shopping? what should I buy if I don't know what I want?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Like everything that has a discount tag! .. kidding! I normally do some research for the prices, and mostly buy clothes and electronics."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What's the best holiday deal you've found in the past?"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "good point. I should ask my teacher if I have to be born with that"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yeah"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. This is a pleasant surprise."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Haha...thanks! how did you like the gift?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Currently unpacking it I guess. How's your morning?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hope you like it! Morning is good. Busy finishing up stuff before the holidays."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think I traveled too much the last couple of months so no holiday for me. But I'm okay with that. Going anywhere exciting?"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Mauii...Hope I like it too. Never been there before."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I visited Maui. It's my second favourite island I've been to, globally. You should try driving on road to Hana. It's a whole day thing but it's worth it."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I just got a matcha latte 🙂 Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?"}]}

They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What do you think are the big advantages? Like personal assistants?"}]}

Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Haha... Well, it sounds like career is really important to you. What matters to you the most in life?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'd say that I want to live for the best possible world in my lifetime.

By a person or an organisation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I was kind of too young to really understand, but apparently there are people who scam Asian immigrants into investing in their own restaurant business. I know that the other part of it was that my mom got sick/hospitalized, and we didn't have insurance. To be honest, I don't really know what really happened versus what my parents want people to think. I just know that one minute I was in the US, and then they put me on a plane to Taiwan, and I never saw my stuff again. In some ways, it made me more sentimental.

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I signed up this time to be a mentee. I have got a good mentor ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wow, that is nice of you. For the mentor program, personally I prefer more 1:1 conversations than the group discussions. The group discussion i useful as well but the topics are too general."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "yeah... I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks for sharing your experience! Now I am thinking maybe I should join as a mentor as well since I enjoyed it as a mentee 🙂"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "neat. what are y'all eating?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don't know!! That's what I'm scared about. Everyone else is a great cook and I'm a klutz. Do you like cooking?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "lol what's a klutz? yeah I like, but I'm not good"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What's your favorite dish to cook? Do you have a go-to?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "ground beef pretty easy"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ah, solid. What's your favorite sport?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I like badminton. I'm quite decent at it"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I played that in high school once or twice. I liked that it's pretty easy for beginners, unlike, say, squash."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "My partner's former friend invited me for lunch (they are not in good books right now).

Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends."}]}

I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you 😉"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oh nice! Is it hard?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "not really, it just requires a lot of patience. You fill up the bait in the crab-pot and drop it in the ocean. Then you wait for a couple of hours to pull the crab-pots out, and voila, you'd have crabs -- if you are lucky!"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oh wow, you sound like an expert! Have you done this before?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "nah! Just watched a lot of youtube videos"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Europe sounds fun! I will just stay home and watch the game. Where in europe do you plan to visit?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I like all the historical sites, so probably France, Germany, or Italy."}]}

It was good to catchup with him"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I actually like to put down some money, but I wouldn't call it my favorite part, since I usually lose it... haha. Catching up with friends is great!

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I guess its a jacket! Very much needed that in the cold 🙂"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's such a great idea, especially at this time of the year. I'm not too big a fan of the cold. I prefer warmer climates. Do you enjoy the cold?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold. I do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oh nice! Where did you live before?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Upstate New York. We got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there. I am so glad to not have to shovel snow now"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "well, it's like a cage match of tennis. The main difference is that both players play in the same 'court' and the ball is smashed against a wall instead of passing it over a net into the opponent's court. Kind of like playing pingpong vs the table."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "it depends haha, there is a lot of bumping into each other to run after the ball, and sometimes the ball hits you too. Overall it feels like a super fast paced version of tennis, really tiring!"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ping pong can get quite intensive too! I guess short ping pong sessions are not that tiring though. Wanna have a match?"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "my pleasure 🙂 do you live near San Mateo?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "no, but I'm willing to drive for good ramen"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "excellent. let me know when you have tried those. I like Parlor better because it has soft-shell crabs"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I\"ve never had softshell crab before, but it sounds really good!"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oh nice! What movie?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Knives Out. It had Daniel Craig and one of the famous Captain America \"Chris\" person (I can't keep track of all of the famous Chris names)."}]}

Traffic might be a little harsh."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?"}]}

Does that work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking. Another option is to have dinner at a restaurant."}]}

Well, I'm not sure... maybe at a party? I'm very bad remembering people so maybe its just that. How are you doing?"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Lol. Not to be elitist but...that's a real job?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah! It is a very demanding job, requires a carefully crafted set of skills. They pay is really good too."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello. Deja Vu."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "what does that mean?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's French for \"already seen.\" I know it's used when you see something for the second time or you have the feeling that something has happened before and you're re-experiencing it."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Interesting. I get that feeling sometimes. It just feels that the event is replaying. Wonder why it happens?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's your mind lapsing somehow."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do you know so much about this French phrase?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I thought it was common. I hear it a lot in popular culture - movies music etc. Jay Z has a song called Deja Vu, so does Beyonce. So I looked it up one time. It's one of those phrases that was carried over exactly to english like \"etcetera\" \"vice versa\" \"savior faire\" and so on. I like cool word origin facts."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "yeah... that's pretty insightful. Never thought of etcetera that way before."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My favourite word origins are gymnasium and jazz."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm actually a cake chef, so not far off! Creepy how good that guess was.... Are you psychic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I had a strong intuitive feeling connected to pastries when we started chatting, but that might have been because I’m hungry."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "haha you're too funny! Perhaps instead of mind-reading powers, you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone..."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hahah love it. Do you have a specialty or favourite type of cake?"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I trained in contemporary and jazz, so I can pick up work in commercials and film clips in between stage shows. So it ends up being all sorts of styles."}]}

I make a lot of the same cakes, day in day out."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, it's different every week, and I love that.

My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes and no. Because it's obviously dangerous, we all have to wear protective clothes. Thus, accidents almost never happen."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, it's the same philosophy. You seem to know a lot about mountain climbing. Do you climb a lot?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I climb very occasionally. My fingertips are not strong enough so I never make too much progress."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Cool. Which conference? I saw on Twitter the other day, some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in Canada. Perhaps it's the same one. I really liked this place called Kingyo. It has good Japanese food if you're into that."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yea it's <REDACTED_TERM>, the largest machine learning conference. I'll check out Kingyo, do we need to make reservation in advance?"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "A sandwich for lunch? Was it filling. I'm currently having some mix of shrimp, fish, chicken and pork. I'm considering going vegetarian though. Lol."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "thats a lot of meat what dish? Why are you consideringt o go vetegarian?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What do you think of those meatless burgers then?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I love them!!!! I've had a couple of different kinds. They are all pretty expensive though. Have you tried them?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I really like the impossible burger Which one is your favorite?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it.

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I think it was Australia"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Do you still talk to the people you met?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yea, me too. I feel like God often puts strangers in front of you, and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways. Do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "what do you mean?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think it's like a 6th sense, often seen as \"cold readings\" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's this practice called \"Treasure Hunting\" that's kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There's a book called \"The Ultimate Treasure Hunt\" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "So, do you do treasure hunting often?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually, they are vague hope-filled messages, but it's weird when I blurt out something oddly specific."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oh really? Has a lot changed in your life recently?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That sounds really cool!

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "😂"}]}

We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ah that's great. My wife also likes Target a lot.

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "The gerbera. It's like a cartoon flower. As if you drew \"flower\" with a crayon and then it came to life."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years.

We are still in planning phase and haven't fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarter."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, so you are already planning for the next quarter. This whole team is always living the future."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hehe, yeah! It seems like the quarter is being pushed earlier than from where it starts 🙂 I like these planning sessions. It makes me feel more confident about the work I am doing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. Some people underestimate the importance of planning, but I think it's very important to have the correct plan. Executing the wrong plan is terrible. Also, planning is fun. You can stack up so many ideas and get great feedbacks."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "True! I think we should set aside some time to discuss some project details? Does tomorrow afternoon work for you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah tomorrow afternoon works for me. Let me set a time on your calendar. Is 3pm good?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Okay. See tomorrow then."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "see you!"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Let's try something different. What about <REDACTED_TERM>? Do you always prefer lunch sync over regular meeting syncs?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah right, I heard the food there is good. I am not sure what they serve there for lunch? On wednesdays."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "We can check the menu then decide :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Actually, the menu looks good. Looking forward to it then."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "It's great, thanks. I'm trying to learn how to make croissants."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Wow that's interesting. I have baked cookies, but croissants seem much more sophisticated. Did you make any progress?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I've done them once or twice so far, but they haven't been flakey enough. I'm trying to figure out why. What kind of cookies have you made?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mint chocolate chips. I think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your oven's temperature."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Ah, good thought, thanks!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants? They don't have to be something unhealthy. For example, melted dark chocolate is good for the heart, and makes the resulting croissants taste much better."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Now that is a good idea. I'll give it a try next time. Would you say you have a sweet tooth?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes. When my top favorite food looks like: cookies, M&M, danish cheese, etc., I know that I have a thing for sweet food. But who doesn't love sweet food? How about you?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Some people don't! But yeah, me too, I think I'd eat pastries all the time if I could get away with it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah I'm afraid I wouldn't. I feel very guilty every time I gulp down an ice cream. But hey, these days there are many types of guilt-free sweet food. For example, there's this ice cream brand called <REDACTED_TERM>. It's only 320 calories a pint. And yes, it preserves most of the normal sweet flavors."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Wow! The last time I paid attention to that sort of stuff was when <REDACTED_TERM> was being marketed as a fat substitute, and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Interesting. I heard about the sweet substitute in a program called the Keto diet. Basically, we try to limit our sugar intake every day. Successful Keto dieters have recommended the <REDACTED_TERM> ice cream to fill their insatiable crave for sugar."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "True! I think thanksgiving is more about sharing. So you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family :P"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "My family eats healthier than I do, so it's all mine 😛 do you like stuffing? I feel like that's only available once a year"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Stuffing! yes please! I wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Also more shopping? what should I buy if I don't know what I want?"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with... Not that you shouldn't try though!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "good point. I should ask my teacher if I have to be born with that"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this. Just aim for med school and enjoy the journey!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yeah"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. This is a pleasant surprise."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Mauii...Hope I like it too. Never been there before."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I visited Maui. It's my second favourite island I've been to, globally. You should try driving on road to Hana. It's a whole day thing but it's worth it."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm great, thanks! I'm meeting some friends for a soccer game soon. What about you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I just got a matcha latte 🙂 Doing some work at my desk. Do you play soccer often? I'm trying to get into doing a regular physical activity"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Yes, but I'm terrible at it. It's fun to play anything with friends, I think. Would you prefer to exercise with a group, or by yourself, do you think?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I think playing a team sport would be fun if it's casual but I primarily run by myself if I exercise. I also got the Ring Fit adventure game on the switch recently. It's basically a game-ified way to exercise"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm thinking about getting a Switch, would you recommend it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes! There are a lot of really great games on the Switch. Two of my favorites are Octopath Traveler and Fire Emblem. Do you play a lot of video games?"}]}

They are now good at even sarcasm I wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "What do you think are the big advantages? Like personal assistants?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I think it can take many different forms as a product. The research implication is also huge! It will signify how AI research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems 🙂 Sort of like stepping on the moon 🙂 I might be overselling it here 😛"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, I agree -- it's such an exciting time to be alive to get to witness all this and be a part of it.

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "The current auto-suggestions already do pretty good 🙂"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah those are actually really good for a few words! I'm imagining like it comes up with a whole conversational response, like a default template"}]}

Regardless, I wouldn't say I believe in miracles - well, if I got promoted next cycle I might change my mind."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Haha... Well, it sounds like career is really important to you. What matters to you the most in life?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Right now, not much. It's unclear. Career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly. I haven't gone through the process of shaping my values. What about you?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'd say that I want to live for the best possible world in my lifetime. It's probably a result of my playing too many video games as a child."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "We didn't have electricity growing up. Explains a lot. Lol."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Does not having had electricity help you empathize more with people of differing backgrounds and/or makes you feel a bit a distance from those who don't understand?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "It makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things. Not sure it makes me empathise with people in general. Where did you grow up?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I grew up in the United States, but my parents were immigrants and ended up being scammed of all their money, so we moved to Taiwan to live with family for a little bit."}]}

By a person or an organisation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I was kind of too young to really understand, but apparently there are people who scam Asian immigrants into investing in their own restaurant business. I know that the other part of it was that my mom got sick/hospitalized, and we didn't have insurance. To be honest, I don't really know what really happened versus what my parents want people to think. I just know that one minute I was in the US, and then they put me on a plane to Taiwan, and I never saw my stuff again. In some ways, it made me more sentimental. Would you say you are more grounded and practical as a result of your background?"}]}

Do you have any netflix recommendations for me?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Netflix has great documentaries on different topics , I particularly liked wild wild country and explained, as for shows you should watch 'billions' Hope you like them!"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "oh right, already seen wild wild country. What is billions about?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It's based on the life of a wall street hedge fund owner, how he makes money and fights with the government when they try to destroy him. Very well made and has a good plot."}]}

For the mentor program, personally I prefer more 1:1 conversations than the group discussions. The group discussion i useful as well but the topics are too general."}]}

I certainly prefer 1:1 as well, but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks for sharing your experience!

Though i don't know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend, but I believe things can always improve between friends."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I hope they do. Getting older already means smaller circles. It sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons. That's good advice though. I fear raising the issue might sound like treason. Lol."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "True about that! I also think time helps to heal certain situations. So may be doing nothing is the best way forward."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "AKA avoiding all texts from everyone?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nope, that would be extreme. May be just putting some balance between the two options."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "People always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is. It's used so often that it's vacuous."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right, I guess that's because there is no one answer to this. It depends on what you value more and some factors around you. Also, life won't be interesting if others are figuring things out for you 😉"}]}

It was good to catchup with him"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Sure hate it! Limits our ability to go out even for a walk! Its good that we don't get to suffer extreme cold weather!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Me too! I moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold.

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Haha thank you, I guess I'm just a natural. What's your favourite game?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I really like to play tennis, badminton and racquetball. I don't really get a chance to play them often though, specially racquetball"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's racquetball like? From context clues, I'm guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "well, it's like a cage match of tennis. The main difference is that both players play in the same 'court' and the ball is smashed against a wall instead of passing it over a net into the opponent's court. Kind of like playing pingpong vs the table."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Wow! A cage match! Does it get physical?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "it depends haha, there is a lot of bumping into each other to run after the ball, and sometimes the ball hits you too. Overall it feels like a super fast paced version of tennis, really tiring!"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "That sounds fun. I think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring, so I don't think it's a sport for me, though!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "ping pong can get quite intensive too! I guess short ping pong sessions are not that tiring though. Wanna have a match?"}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "I just met someone who went diving in Australia. Apparently, you cannot fly 24 hrs after you dive, because your body accumulates too much <REDACTED_TERM> when breathing with a cylinder So, don't do that!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for the tip! I don't plan on going diving, I plan to hike the mountains and go see kangaroos!"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "That's equally amazing! I wish I can explore such places one day. It's just so expensive"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I won a lot of money through the lottery 🙂"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "woah!... You know sharing is caring. You should share that money with me :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Haha, very true! Besides the trip, I donated the rest to charity so I will need to go back to work when I get back"}]}

I wish I could live part-time in different parts of the world to have summer all year round. Have you ever visited the southern hemisphere?"}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Yes! I've been to Australia. It was very nice; I regret not going to see the southern lights. Me personally, I like winter.

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Great idea! I will probably do the same. Surprise surprise.... Traffic might be a little harsh."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah... thats a shame but nothing we can do about it. What do you plan to do about dinner the 24th? Do the rooms in the resort have kitchens?"}]}

Does that work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, I think so. It might be a tough decision though, if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking.

I still can't play them for a long time though"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "right, but bar chords are so versatile, almost like cheating as in you can play anything with the same gesture"}]}

Meaningful work life; this may mean exploring around with new stuff 3. multiple hobbies that keep you busy ... so on 🙂 What about you? is there a right answer to this? :)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1) The idea of what it must be like to be \"on Earth as it is in Heaven\" from the Lord's prayer. I feel like we were designed for a purpose, rather than random chance. A more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can. 2) Taking care of myself physically, mentally, spiritually. 3) Family 4) Work 5) Music"}]}

That's very thoughtful and spiritual 🙂 Also music earned a spot 🙂 yay!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yea, I've always said that if I wrote a memoire, I would title it: \"Jazz, Jesus, and Video Games.\" Do you have a title of a book that you've thought of writing before?"}]}

I hear it a lot in popular culture - movies music etc. Jay Z has a song called Deja Vu, so does Beyonce. So I looked it up one time. It's one of those phrases that was carried over exactly to english like \"etcetera\" \"vice versa\" \"savior faire\" and so on. I like cool word origin facts."}]}

Are you psychic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I had a strong intuitive feeling connected to pastries when we started chatting, but that might have been because I’m hungry."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Woah! Very cool! What style of dance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I trained in contemporary and jazz, so I can pick up work in commercials and film clips in between stage shows. So it ends up being all sorts of styles."}]}

{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I went to school for it and so I find the literature quite convincing. I've also seen its benefits firsthand in my practice. It revolves around the Chinese notion of Qi."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Lol. Bro...I don't buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by 6 independent parties. Who wrote the literature?

My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach."}]}
{"message": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes that's close.
